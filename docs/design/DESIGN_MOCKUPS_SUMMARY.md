## üöÄ Next Step

**Import these mockups into your Figma file:**
1. Download the PNG files from `mcpollinations-output/` folder
2. Open your Figma file: https://www.figma.com/design/Xyl5Or2EWoXqfBXgPrykCq/Loja-Africana-Rosa
3. Drag the PNGs into Figma as design references
4. Create actual components and screens using these mockups as visual guides
5. Apply design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)

Once the Figma file is complete with actual components, I can:
- Extract design tokens via MCP Figma
- Generate Angular components automatically
- Create production-ready code with Tailwind CSS

**All design assets are ready in:** `mcpollinations-output/`
**Files generated:** 8 mockups (5 mobile + 1 desktop + 2 system reference)
